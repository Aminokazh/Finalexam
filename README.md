My final project can be divided into 2 parts:
1. Authorization proccess
2. APIs and carousel

We start with the "node app.js". On the localhost:3000 appears page "registration".
After entering the data they are getting stored in database and user gets welcome message on his gmail.
Then it redirects to the page "success".
We can scan the QR code or use key to login. (I wished)

To activate the second part we enter "node server.js".
On the localhost:3000 appears page "index". It has navigation bar and carousel of images.
In navbar we can move to the page "Fashion". It contains Unsplash API for high quality images. I used it to search for "Old money" conception photos.
The other page "News" contains News API. I specifically filtered news of Korea.
I chose those APIs since they are accurately describe Jennie Kim (my favorite singer).
